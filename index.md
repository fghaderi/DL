# Course Description
The purpose of this course is to review the main concpets behind the deep neural networks. We learn about the required maths for developing different neural network architectures. Important deep architectures including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, autoencoders, etc. will be reviewed. 


# Prerequisites
- Basic concepts of machine learning.
- Programming knowledge (programming will be in python).
